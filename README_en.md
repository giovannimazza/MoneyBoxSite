# MoneyBox

Welcome to MoneyBox, a web application all-in-one page designed to help you keep track of your personal finances. 
With MoneyBox, you can easily record all your incoming and outgoing transactions and view a summary of your total expenses by category. 
This will help you stay on top of your budget and identify areas where you can reduce your spending.

## Description

You can assign each transaction to a specific category, such as home, food, or entertainment and transport expenses. 
MoneyBox will automatically calculate your total expenses for each category and provide you with a chart to visualize them clearly.
You will be able to create a Spending Plan with your custom name and it'll auto-generate a unique code to share your spending plan with your friends.

If you are an Admin, you will be able to:
* Create new categories
* Delete categories
* Send a message notifications to all the users
* Create a report that will display all the registered users
* Delete users' account
